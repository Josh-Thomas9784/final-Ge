        <h3>Overview - $10,000 to $30,000</h3>
        <p>Solar panels, equipped with photovoltaic cells, play a pivotal role in transforming sunlight into a sustainable and clean source of electricity. The utilization of solar energy contributes significantly to minimizing our dependence on conventional energy sources, fostering a transition toward a more sustainable and eco-friendly power generation system.

          One of the primary advantages of solar panels is their versatility in installation. They can be affixed to rooftops, seamlessly integrating with existing structures, or deployed in open spaces to form solar farms. This adaptability makes solar power systems suitable for a range of environments, from urban areas to rural expanses, enhancing their applicability across diverse landscapes.
          
          Cost is a critical factor in the widespread adoption of solar energy. The installation costs are influenced by various factors, including the size of the solar system and its geographical location. On average, solar panel installations can range from $10,000. However, the encouraging news is that the prices have been on a downward trajectory over the years. Technological advancements, increased production, and growing market competition have collectively contributed to making solar energy more affordable and accessible.
          
          Another significant incentive for adopting solar power is the availability of tax rebates. The Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is a key policy supporting the transition to solar energy in the United States. Under this program, individuals or businesses investing in solar installations are eligible for a 26% tax credit as of 2020 and 2021 with congress passing an extension to raise it to 30%. This initiative has played a pivotal role in making solar energy more financially viable for consumers. It's important to note that as of 2022, the ITC covers 26% of the installation costs, but it is always advisable to stay updated on policy changes that may impact the credit percentage or expiration date.
          
          In conclusion, the combination of advancing technology, decreasing installation costs, and supportive government policies, such as tax rebates, positions solar energy as a compelling and sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources. As the world continues to prioritize environmental conservation and renewable energy, solar power emerges as a key player in shaping a greener and more resilient future.</p>

        <h3>D.I.Y</h3>
        <p>** Requires a good understanding of electrical systems and safety precautions. If you're unsure about any aspect of the process, it's best to consult with a professional or consider purchasing commercially manufactured solar panels instead. Additionally, always prioritize safety when working with electricity and power tools. 

          <br>
          <br>

          1. Research and Planning: 
          
             Begin by researching the basics of solar panels, including how they work and the materials needed. 
          
             Determine the size and number of solar panels you want to build based on your energy needs and available space. 
          
            <br>
            <br>
          
          2. Gather Materials: 
          
             Purchase solar cells (also known as photovoltaic cells). These are the most crucial components of your solar panels. 
          
             Obtain other necessary materials such as a backing material (such as plywood), glass or plexiglass for covering, silicone sealant, tabbing wire, flux pen, junction box, and soldering equipment. 
          
            <br>
            <br>
          
          3. Assemble the Solar Cells: 
          
             Lay out the solar cells on your backing material, ensuring they're properly aligned and spaced. 
          
             Solder the solar cells together using tabbing wire, connecting the positive side of one cell to the negative side of the next. 
          
             Use a flux pen to apply flux to the solder points before soldering, as this helps ensure a good connection. 
          
            <br>
            <br>
          
          4. Connect the Cells: 
          
             Connect the solar cells in series or parallel depending on your desired voltage and current output. 
          
             Use tabbing wire and a soldering iron to make these connections. Be careful not to apply too much heat, as excessive heat can damage the cells. 
          
            <br>
            <br>
          
          5. Protective Covering: 
          
             Once the cells are connected, cover them with glass or plexiglass to protect them from the elements. 
          
             Seal the edges with silicone sealant to prevent moisture from getting inside. 
          
            <br>
            <br>
          
          6. Install a Junction Box: 
          
             Attach a junction box to the back of the solar panel to house the electrical connections. 
          
             Run wires from the solar cells to the junction box, making sure to secure them properly. 
          
            <br>
            <br>
          
          7. Test the Panel: 
          
             Before installing your DIY solar panel, test it to ensure it's functioning correctly. 
          
             Use a multimeter to measure the voltage and current output of the panel under sunlight. 
          
            <br>
            <br>
          
          8. Install and Mount: 
          
             Once you've confirmed that your DIY solar panel is working properly, you can install and mount it in a suitable location, such as on your roof or in your yard. 
          
             Follow all safety guidelines and local regulations when installing your solar panel. </p>
