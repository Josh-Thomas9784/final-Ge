        <h2>Green Roofs</h2>
        <p class="text2">Green roofs offer a multitude of environmental, economic, and social benefits. They contribute to
          stormwater management by absorbing and controlling rainwater runoff, improve air quality through pollutant
          absorption, and regulate temperatures, thereby reducing the need for energy-intensive heating and cooling. Green
          roofs also enhance urban biodiversity, serving as habitats for wildlife, while providing aesthetic appeal and
          recreational spaces for communities. Additionally, these roofs can extend the lifespan of buildings by acting as
          a protective layer, contribute to reduced urban heat island effects, and potentially increase property values,
          making them a sustainable and multifaceted solution for urban development.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box" id="Windows">
        <h2>Energy Efficient Windows</h2>
        <p class="text2">Energy-efficient windows offer a range of advantages in terms of environmental sustainability
          and economic efficiency. These windows are designed to minimize heat transfer, providing effective insulation
          and reducing the need for excessive heating or cooling. By preventing heat loss in colder seasons and heat gain
          in warmer ones, energy-efficient windows contribute to lower energy consumption, resulting in potential cost
          savings. Additionally, they often incorporate features such as low-emissivity coatings and multiple glazing
          layers to enhance thermal performance, while also blocking harmful ultraviolet rays that can damage furnishings
          and contribute to increased indoor comfort. Overall, energy-efficient windows play a crucial role in promoting
          both environmental conservation and economic benefits for building occupants.</p>

      <div class="info-box" id="Materials">
        <h2>Sustainable Building Materials</h2>
        <p class="text2">Sustainable building materials play a pivotal role in fostering environmentally conscious
          construction practices and long-term economic viability. These materials are sourced, produced, and utilized in
          ways that minimize environmental impact throughout their life cycle. Incorporating sustainable materials
          contributes to resource conservation, reduces carbon emissions, and promotes a healthier indoor environment.
          Examples include recycled steel, reclaimed wood, and low-emission adhesives. By selecting materials with
          eco-friendly certifications and considering factors like recyclability and energy efficiency, construction
          projects can achieve a reduced ecological footprint, ensuring a more sustainable and resilient built
          environment.</p>

      <div class="info-box" id="GE">
        <h2>Efficient HVAC System</h2>
        <p class="text2">Energy-efficient HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems offer substantial
          benefits in terms of both environmental sustainability and economic efficiency. These systems are designed to
          optimize energy usage, resulting in reduced energy consumption and lower utility costs. Features such as
          programmable thermostats, high-efficiency heat exchangers, and variable-speed technologies enable precise
          control of indoor climate conditions. By minimizing energy waste and employing advanced technologies,
          energy-efficient HVAC systems contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions and lessen the overall
          environmental impact of buildings. Investing in such systems not only enhances energy performance but also
          improves indoor air quality, creating healthier and more comfortable living and working environments.</p>
