            <h2>Revolutionizing Energy with Green Technologies</h2>
            <p>Green energy technologies are reshaping the way we power our homes, businesses, and communities. From solar and wind to hydro and geothermal, renewable energy sources offer sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels.</p>
            <p><img src="pictures/solar.jpg" alt="Solar panels"></p>
            <p>Solar energy is one of the most accessible and widely adopted renewable energy sources. Through the installation of solar panels on rooftops or in open spaces, homeowners and businesses can harness the power of the sun to generate electricity.</p>
            <p>Wind power is another prominent green energy solution, particularly in regions with strong and consistent winds. Wind turbines, whether on land or offshore, capture wind energy and convert it into electricity to power homes, industries, and even entire cities.</p>
            <p>Hydropower, generated from the flow of water in rivers, streams, and tidal currents, is a reliable and established renewable energy source. Micro-hydropower systems can be installed in various locations, providing a constant and sustainable supply of electricity.</p>
            <p>Geothermal energy taps into the Earth's natural heat to generate power for heating, cooling, and electricity generation. By harnessing the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface, geothermal systems offer efficient and environmentally-friendly energy solutions.</p>
            <p>These green energy technologies not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change but also create new opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the renewable energy sector.</p>
             <!-- Policy Changes -->

        <h3>Incentives for Renewable Energy</h2>
        <p>Government incentives are being introduced to promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies. These incentives may include tax credits, rebates, grants, or feed-in tariffs to encourage individuals, businesses, and communities to invest in green energy solutions.</p>
  


        <h3>Government Funding for Green Initiatives</h2>
        <p>Government agencies are allocating funding to support research, development, and implementation of renewable energy projects. This funding aims to accelerate the transition to clean energy and stimulate innovation in green technologies.</p>



        <h3>Regulatory Support for Renewable Energy Systems</h2>
        <p>Regulatory bodies are implementing policies to facilitate the integration of renewable energy into existing infrastructure. These policies include streamlined permitting processes, grid access regulations, and standards for renewable energy installations.</p>
